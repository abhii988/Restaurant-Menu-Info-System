# Restaurant-Menu-Info-System
Restaurant Menu Info System created using Java

The aim of this assessment was work in a group and to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) information system that stores details of the menu of a restaurant and the user could search item(s) according to its type or price as required using the java programming language. 
This system uses the object-oriented programming methodology along with the implementation of binary search and selection sorting.
The code was written in such a way that a set of preserved data would be loaded in the menu and the user could add more items to the menu. The new data is then saved and is written into the CSV file but the data should be created already and manually loaded.
